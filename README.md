OH. MY. GOODNESS. Collaborations are amazing. Share ideas, code, etc. with others is the best way to share knowledge, mutual enthusiasms, and a lot of times we make cool friends along the way. I welcome contributions in many ways, shapes, and forms:

- [Email Me](mailto:iansterlingferguson@gmail.com) and just plain tell me what you like, do not like, would like to see changed... just give me a compliment before laying it on me
- FORK IT ALL - create a fork, clone it down, mess it up, do the neato commits and comments, push it back, test it at least a million times, then submit a pull request for me to review and merge into the project if I think you are cool (and the code is cool too) - but again, the nice thing to do would be emailing me first and telling me your intentions... and don't forget the compliment part

Something, something... Have your people call my people. And by call, I mean email - who answers the phone these days?
